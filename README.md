# Hadith Semantic Search

## Project Overview

- This semantic search system is designed to easily locate relevant Hadiths. Utilizing advanced NLP techniques with BERT embeddings, this tool provides contextually accurate search capabilities within a comprehensive Hadith database.
- Developed as an assignment for the Icog Lab's Training II: "Intro to NLP by Kewser Seid"

## Developer

- **Name**: Abdulmunim Jundurahman Jemal
- **Organization**: Icog Labs
- **Date**: June 9, 2024
- **Location**: Addis Ababa, Ethiopia

## Inspiration

The project was inspired by the challenges faced by Sheiks who often struggle to find and sort relevant Hadiths while preparing for Friday sermons. This tool aims to simplify and enhance the accessibility of religious texts, making sermon preparation more efficient.

## Features

- **Semantic Search**: Users can search for Hadiths using natural language queries to find the most relevant texts for their needs.
- **BERT Embeddings**: Leverages pre-trained BERT models to generate semantic embeddings, ensuring accurate and relevant search results.

## Future Plans

- **User Interface**: Plans to develop a more interactive and user-friendly web interface.
- **Feedback Mechanism**: Implementation of a feedback system where users can rate the relevance of the search results to continuously improve the tool.

## Installation
